## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these detailed steps.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Visual Studio 2022**
    -   Make sure the **.NET desktop development** workload is installed.
2.  **MySQL Server & Workbench**
    -   Download and install from the official [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).
    -   During installation, remember your `root` password.
3.  **Internet Connection**
    -   Required for the CoinGecko API to fetch live coin prices.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-mining-calculator.git
    ```

2.  **Database Setup**
    -   Open **MySQL Workbench** and connect to your local server.
    -   Create a new schema (database) for the project. Let's name it `crypto_calc_db`.
      ```
      CREATE SCHEMA `crypto_calc_db`;
      ```
    -   Run the provided `database_schema.sql` file (you will need to create this file with your table structures) to set up the necessary tables (`users`, `calculations`, etc.).

3.  **Configure the Application**
    -   Open the project solution (`.sln` file) in **Visual Studio 2022**.
    -   Locate the module or class where the database connection string is defined (e.g., a file named `DBConnect.vb`).
    -   Update the connection string with your MySQL server details:
      ```
      ' Example Connection String in your database module
      Dim connStr As String = "server=127.0.0.1;user=root;password=YOUR_PASSWORD;database=crypto_calc_db;"
      ```
      Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the MySQL root password you set during installation.

4.  **Install NuGet Packages**
    -   Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select **"Manage NuGet Packages..."**.
    -   Go to the "Browse" tab and ensure the following packages are installed:
        -   `MySql.Data`
        -   `Newtonsoft.Json`

5.  **Build and Run**
    -   Build the solution by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
    -   Run the project by pressing `F5` or clicking the "Start" button. The login form should appear.
